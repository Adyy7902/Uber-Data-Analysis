**Analysis Highlights:**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Examined data distribution and identified potential patterns.
    * Cleaned and preprocessed the data for further analysis.
* **Rush Hour Detection:**
    * Analyzed ride frequency across different days, hours, and weeks.
    * Employed crosstab function to identify peak periods. 
    * Created point plots to visualize trends in rush hours.
* **Interactive Visualizations:**
    * Generated various plots using libraries like plotly to create interactive  visualizations for:
        * Bar plots

* **Spatial Analysis with Heatmap:**
    * Leveraged the folium library to create a heatmap on a world map, potentially visualizing ride density based on latitude and longitude values (assuming location data was available).
